This code implements the Raft Consensus Alorithm in Java that ensures continuously updating state-machines agree on the updates being committed.

This was a class project. We were responsible for implementing the files: LeaderMode, FollowerMode, and CandidateMode. These are found in 
p3 -> src -> edu -> duke -> -> raft.

p3 -> serverlogs holds the output of each server, which can be used to verify that the output is correct once the program is run.

I worked on this project with Nick Widmaier and Olivia Zhu.
